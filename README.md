Car Price Prediction Model using Python

The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. The dataset I’m using here to train a car price prediction model was downloaded from Kaggle. It contains data about all the main features that contribute to the price of a car. So let’s start this task by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset:

Python Libraries used :

Numpy
Panda
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Sklearn
Applied

Plotgraph
Heatmap
Training a Car Price Prediction Model

I will use the decision tree regression algorithm to train a car price prediction model. So let’s split the data into training and test sets and use the decision tree regression algorithm to train the model:

Technologies Used :

Python
Machine Learning
IDE - Google Collab
